## opentui

opentui is the framework used to render the tui, using react.

IMPORTANT! before starting every task ALWAYS read opentui docs with `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sst/opentui/refs/heads/main/packages/react/README.md`

ALWAYS!


## bun

NEVER run bun run index.tsx. You cannot directly run the tui app. it will hang. instead ask me to do so.

use bun add to install packages instead of npm

## React

NEVER pass function or callbacks as dependencies of useEffect, this will very easily cause infinite loops if you forget to use useCallback

NEVER use useCallback. it is useless if we never pass functions in useEffect dependencies

Try to never use useEffect if possible. usually you can move logic directly in event handlers instead

## Rules

- keep types as close as possible to rayacst
- DO NOT use as any. instead try to understand how to fix the types in other ways
- to implement compound components like `List.Item` first define the type of List, using a interface, then use : to implement it and add compound components later using . and omitting the props types given they are already typed by the interface, here is an example
- DO NOT use console.log. only use logger.log instead
- <input> uses onInput not onChange. it is passed a simple string value and not an event object
- to render examples components use renderWithProviders not render
- ALWAYS bind all class methods to `this` in the constructor. This ensures methods work correctly when called in any context (callbacks, event handlers, etc). Example:

  ```typescript
  constructor(options: Options) {
    // Initialize properties
    this.prop = options.prop

    // Bind all methods to this instance
    this.method1 = this.method1.bind(this)
    this.method2 = this.method2.bind(this)
    this.privateMethod = this.privateMethod.bind(this)
  }
  ```

## reading github repositories

you can use gitchamber.com to read repo files. run `curl https://gitchamber.com` to see how the API works. always use curl to fetch the responses of gitchamber.com

for example when working with the vercel ai sdk, you can fetch the latest docs using:

https://gitchamber.com/repos/repos/vercel/ai/main/files

use gitchamber to read the .md files using curl


## researching opentui patterns

you can read more examples of opentui react code using gitchamber by listing and reading files from the correct endpoint: https://gitchamber.com/repos/sst/opentui/main/files?glob=packages/react/examples/**
